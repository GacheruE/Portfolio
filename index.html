            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Strathmore University, where I delved into a range of computer science topics, from algorithms and data structures to software engineering principles. This academic journey has equipped me with a robust understanding of the core concepts that underpin effective software development.

My technical toolkit includes a variety of languages, frameworks, and tools relevant to web development. Proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy creating visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. On the back end, I've honed my skills with technologies like PHP and databases such as MongoDB. Additionally, I'm familiar with version control systems like Git.

Web development, with its dynamic nature and ever-evolving technologies, has captured my imagination. I find joy in turning creative ideas into functional and user-friendly websites. Whether it's building interactive interfaces, optimizing performance, or solving complex challenges, I'm driven by the desire to create seamless online experiences.

The fast-paced nature of the tech industry motivates me to stay on the cutting edge. I am committed to continuous learning, keeping up with the latest web development trends, and exploring new technologies that enhance my skill set.

While I thrive in the technical realm, I understand the importance of effective communication and collaboration. I approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset, always seeking to contribute positively to team dynamics.

I am excited about the endless possibilities that web development offers, and I am ready to embark on a journey where I can apply my skills, learn, and contribute to building innovative solutions that make a positive impact.

Let's connect and explore the boundless opportunities that lie ahead
